# Retrieve metagenomes from curatedMetagenomicData

Jacobo de la Cuesta-Zuluaga. December 2019.

This repo contains files and code to obtain the latest samples from the `curatedMetagenomicData` package, filter it and prepare tables for download using the LLMGQC pipeline.

*Note* that notebook 01 is using the development version of `curatedMetagenomicData` and **requires the development version of `R`, i.e. `v.4.0`**. However, the complete metadata file of the package can be found in `./CurMetDat-metagenomes/Complete_CurMetDat.tsv`, and further analyses can be done just by importing this file.
