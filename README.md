Welcome to your new project. This document explains the directory
tree structure that has been set up for you. We encourage you to keep
this stucture.

data/
        * Intended for raw data and results. Backed up regularly. Do
          not store any intermediate files here. See tmp below.
tmp/
        * All intermediate files, data that could be recreated easily,
          and data that do not need to be backed up.
code/
        * We recommend to separate data from code, hence this directory.
          In addition, it is considered a good idea to keep source code
          under version control, so this directory is already initialized
          for git usage.
doc/
        * Documentation of your project data and code.
